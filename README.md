This project transforms our Project 1 function library into a fully object-oriented system designed to analyze health-related articles for misinformation.

We implemented 5 core classes that work together to:
	•	Clean and process article text
	•	Extract claims and citations
	•	Compare claims to a trusted glossary
	•	Score risk based on mismatches
	•	Generate detailed analysis reports
	•	Summarize trends across multiple articles
